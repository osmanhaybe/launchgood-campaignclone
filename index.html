          <h4>Summary:</h4>
          <p>A famine has been developing in South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia, Kenya, and Ethiopia. More than 7.5 million people in Sudan and 6.2 million people in Somalia are in desperate need of basic humanitarian aid like food, water, and medical assistance. In ONE month 1.3 million people in crisis will double to 2.4 million in Kenya while famine has officially been declared and has been raging in regions of South Sudan. This crowd-funding effort will be used to fund Islamic Relief Canada's immediate emergency projects focused on water and food assistance, as well as prevention programs to increase household resilience to drought</p>

          <h4>Challenge:</h4>
          <p>The crisis is severe and immediate. People in these regions are facing starvation and are dying in hundreds every day while around 30% of children in the region are facing severe malnutrition. If we do not act swiftly enough, it will be too late to save millions. Without immediate help the region will soon face an increase in displacement, which is already hindering people’s access to food, water, and other basic aids. Resulting humanitarian efforts afterwards will be insufficient to address the increasing levels of starvation and malnutrition.</p> 


          <h4>Solution:</h4>
          <p>Our sincere and instant actions can save lives by bringing food, water, and other necessities to these people in need. The UTSC Muslim Student’s Association, East African Student’s Association, UTSC R.A.Y.S, Somali Student’s Association, Muslim Chaplaincy UTSC, Pakistani Student's Association at UTSC, Together We Stand, Scarborough Campus Students'Union , Racialized Students Collective,  Global Youth Impact, Co-op Students' Association,  Linguistic Student Association, Hindu Students' Council, Unity at UTSC,  Islamic Relief UTSC, and Racialized Young Professionals are working collectively to raise $5000 in the span of a few weeks. All proceeds will go to Islamic Relief Canada.Islamic Relief Canada is currently responding to the devastating impact of conflict and climate in each country through immediate emergency projects focused on water and food assistance, as well as prevention programs to increase household resilience to drought.</p> 


          <h4>Islamic Relief Canada's Ongoing projects in East Africa</h4>

          <h4>Kenya</h4>
          <img src="images/kenya-min.jpg" alt="Kenya">
          <p>IRC is providing sustainable water supplies to the conflict prone area of Wargadud. More specifically, they will be: 
          1. Drilling and equipping one borehole with generator sets, submersible pumps,elevated water tanks, pipeline/distribution systems and civil works of powerhouse and water vending points/kiosks.

          2. Building capacity of the water user associations to sustain and maintain the established water systems with minimum costs.</p> 





          <h4>Somalia</h4>
          <img src="images/somaliafamine-min.jpg" alt="Somalia">
          <p>IRC is supporting 600 extremely poor and vulnerable orphan households(3600 individuals) in Garowe and the neighboring region to provide access to food and livelihood security, as well as empowerment and social development. Orphan families will be economically transformed and will have income raised to meet their daily basic necessities. By the end of the project, there will be an improved standard of living in orphan families earning at-least $2 dollars a day and children will have access to education.</p> 





          <h4>Ethiopia</h4>
          <img src="images/ethiopia-min.jpg" alt="Ethiopia">
          <p>IRC will be dispatching mobile health teams to the drought afflicted populations, and providing emergency health care to the neediest families(mainly focusing on pregnant women, new mothers and children under the age of 5). IRC will also be providing emergency water supplies through water wells to the affected families and providing basic hygiene training to raise awareness on water borne illnesses and how to prevent them.</p> 





          <h4>South Sudan:</h4>
          <img src="images/southsudan-min.jpg" alt="South Sudan">
          <p>IRC is targeting close to 10,000 IDPs (International displaced person)who are facing acute shortages of water, food and other psychological support.The project will provide food packets for the affected population, as well as provision of water through water trucking, and distribution of mosquito nets and blankets.</p> 







          <h4>Sudan</h4>
          <img src="images/sudan-min.jpg" alt="Sudan">
          <p>This project is intended to address food insecurity and livelihood vulnerability of IDPs and vulnerable host communities. The strategy of this intervention is to support and reinforce positive coping and adaptive mechanisms, strengthening resilience,and enhancing self-reliance. The interventions are geared towards enabling beneficiaries to produce their own food, increase food accessibility and maintain the natural resource base.</p>  




          <p class="final-p">Every single dollar counts! For a growing number of people, it is a matter of <b>life or death</b>. We implore everyone to contribute as much as they can.</p>
